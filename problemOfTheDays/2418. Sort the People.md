### 2418. Sort the People


### You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

### For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

### Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

 

Example 1:

Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
Example 2:

Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
 

Constraints:

n == names.length == heights.length
1 <= n <= 103
1 <= names[i].length <= 20
1 <= heights[i] <= 105
names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
All the values of heights are distinct.


### Optimal 

```java
class Pair {
    int height;
    String name; 
    Pair(int height, String name){
        this.height = height;
        this.name = name;
    }
}
class Solution {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        ArrayList<Pair> list = new ArrayList();
        for(int i=0;i<names.length;i++){
            Pair p = new Pair(heights[i], names[i]);
            list.add(p);
        }
        Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> b.height - a.height);
        
        String arr[] = new String[list.size()];
        int i =0;
        for(Pair P : list){
            arr[i] = P.name;
            i++;
        }
        return arr;
    } 
}
```
