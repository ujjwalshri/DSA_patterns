### 2582. Pass the Pillow


## There are n people standing in a line labeled from 1 to n. The first person in the line is holding a pillow initially. Every second, the person holding the pillow passes it to the next person standing in the line. Once the pillow reaches the end of the line, the direction changes, and people continue passing the pillow in the opposite direction.

## For example, once the pillow reaches the nth person they pass it to the n - 1th person, then to the n - 2th person and so on.
# Given the two positive integers n and time, return the index of the person holding the pillow after time seconds.

### Simulations approach 

## intuition -> Just take a flip varible which is going to be boolean and is gonna flip everytime we reach the last mans

```java
class Solution {
    public int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        boolean flipDirection = false;
        int curMan = 1;
      while(time--> 0){
        if(flipDirection == false){
        
            curMan++;
        }else if(flipDirection == true){
            
            curMan--;
        }
        if(curMan >= n || curMan<=1){
            flipDirection = !flipDirection;
        }
       
      }
      return curMan;
    }
}
```
