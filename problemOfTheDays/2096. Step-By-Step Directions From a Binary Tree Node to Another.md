### 2096. Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another

### You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.

### Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

### 'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
### 'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
### 'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
### Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.


Example 1:


Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.
Example 2:


Input: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
Output: "L"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node.val <= n
All the values in the tree are unique.
1 <= startValue, destValue <= n
startValue != destValue
 


### Brute force code 

### Approach 
- We will use a dfs to traverse the tree and store the parent of each node in a hashmap
- We will also store the level of each node in a hashmap
- We will start from the start node and traverse the tree until we reach the destination node
- We will keep track of the level of the node and the parent of the node
- We will use a stack to store the directions to reach the destination node
- We will pop the stack when we reach the destination node and return the directions in reverse order
- Time complexity: O(n)



### Optimized Approach

### Approach - when ever we want to find the shortest path between two distinct nodes in a binary tree , that paths the lowest common ancestor always, because that is the closest node that connects both the directions of the two different nodes, 

- The shortest path between any two nodes in a tree must pass through their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). The path will travel upwards from node s to the LCA and then downwards from the LCA to node t.

- Find the path strings from root → s, and root → t. Can you use these two strings to prepare the final answer?
