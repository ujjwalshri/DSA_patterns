### You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

### You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

### Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104


```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int minTillNow = prices[0];
        for(int i =1;i<prices.length; i++){
            int pro = prices[i] - minTillNow;
            if(pro < 0 ) pro =0;
            maxProfit = Math.max(pro, maxProfit);
            System.out.println(maxProfit);
            minTillNow = Math.min(minTillNow, prices[i]);
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}
```

### Brute force 

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int ans  = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i =0;i<prices.length-1;i++){
            int buy = prices[i];
            for(int j = i+1;j<prices.length;j++){
              int sell = prices[j];
              int pro = sell - buy;
              if(pro < 0) pro = 0;
              ans  = Math.max(ans, pro);
            }
        }
        return ans == Integer.MIN_VALUE ? 0 : ans;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
     
    }
}
